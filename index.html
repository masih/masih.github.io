<h1>Masih Hajiarab Derkani</h1>

<p>I am a software engineer at <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, business platform services. I currently work on a highly resilient distributed message dissemination system with guaranteed sequential consistency and at-least-once delivery.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk">university of St Andrews, school of Computer Science</a>. I worked with <a class="externalLink" href="http://graham.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Dr. Graham Kirby</a> and <a class="externalLink" href="http://al.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Prof. Alan Dearle</a> on <a class="externalLink" href="http://digitisingscotland.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.html">Digitising Scotland</a>, a project constructing a linked genealogy of 24 million Scottish historical records since 1855.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I worked on <a class="externalLink" href="http://qraqrbox.com">Qraqrbox</a>, a university spinout company providing a distributed delay-tolerant content delivery platform powered by renewable energies.</p>
<p>In <a class="externalLink" href="http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6761">my PhD</a>, I investigated algorithmic adaptation of routing state maintenance in structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlays, where the scope of adaptation is enlarged to include the maintenance algorithm itself rather than being limited to the parameter values of a single algorithm. I confirmed the hypothesis that a <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-based_routing">Key-based Routing (KBR)</a> system can automatically and dynamically adapt the structure of its maintenance algorithm to changing environments, and can do so in a fully decentralised manner without any human intervention, and outperform static KBR systems such as <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)">Chord</a> in terms of performance and resource consumption, i.e. lookup correctness, lookup latency and bandwidth usage. I had the privilege of completing my PhD under the supervision of <a class="externalLink" href="http://graham.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Dr. Graham Kirby</a>. My work was generously funded by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/">Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to my PhD, I received my MSc in &#x201c;Advanced Computer Science&#x201d; from the university of St. Andrews. My Master&#x2019;s thesis, titled &#x201c;Trombone: A Zero-Hop, Zero-Configuration Peer-to-Peer Routing Algorithm&#x201d;, was supervised by <a class="externalLink" href="http://al.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Prof. Alan Dearle</a>, which led to my PhD studies. I was kindly awarded the 2010 Master&#x2019;s class medal.</p>
<p>My research interests include distributed systems, P2P systems, software architecture/engineering, autonomic computing and unsupervised machine learning.</p>
